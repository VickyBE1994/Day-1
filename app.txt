Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1
-> It was developed by the Berners Lee in 1989 and this version is still in use.
-> It works on the text format, so that all the request and response are in text form.
-> GET and POST method is used by the Client to send the request to the servers.
-> HTTP/1.1 send the data one by one when the client makes request to the server,
   if a single data is ot loaded then other sources will be blocked.
-> In this, to speed up the web page, it compresses the HTTP messages into smaller
   one and it is done by itself.

HTTP/2
-> It was primarily developed at the google and published in May 2015.
-> It is better than HTTP/1.1 because in this prioritization is well developed.
-> Weighed prioritization is a feature of this HTTP/2, this prioritization
   allows the developer to decide which page should load first.
-> When the client send the request to the server, the server will response with 
   the number of data to the client at once, not by sending one by one. This method 
   is known as multiplexing.
-> And the developer will assing the data with different weighed value, so that the 
   value tells which data should render first.
-> HPACK an advanced compression method is used in HTTP/2 for better performance,
   this deletes the unwanted information from HTTP header packets.
